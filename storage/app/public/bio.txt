My name is Wyatt Johnson. I'm a Software Engineer in Logan, Utah. I love Miatas, video games, my cats, my wife, and anything techy. I really enjoy building simple projects that I can use in my daily life.
<br><br>I have been working in the industry for over two years now and I am currently employed at Malouf Companies, which is based here in Cache Valley. And here's a photo of me!
